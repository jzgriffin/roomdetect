# CS120B

This repository contains the quarter project that I completed in CS120B,
Introduction to Embedded Systems, at UC Riverside in spring 2017.  The
project was a room detector using a trained statistical model running on
a pair of ATmega1284p microcontrollers.  For more information, see the
full report in the report directory.
